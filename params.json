{"name":"Battleship","tagline":"Battleship game","body":"###Battleship game (Zeeslag)\r\n```\r\nCreated by Jonathan van der Steege (March 2014)\r\njonakeys@hotmail.com\r\nWritten in C++\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Goal\r\nTwo players battle to rule the open sea. The goal is to destroy all of the enemy's ships. The first player who does so, wins the game. A ship is destroyed when all it's coordinates are revealed.\r\n\r\n###Start\r\nThe game starts with each player placing their ships on the playing field. Ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically and aren't allowed to be adjacent to each other.\r\n\r\nEach player has 10 ships: 1 Battleship (4 4 4 4) 2 Cruisers (3 3 3) (3 3 3) 3 Torpedo Boats (2 2) (2 2) (2 2) 4 Submarines (1) (1) (1) (1)\r\n\r\n###Battles\r\nIn turn, each player fires a shot. When it hits, the number of the ship is revealed. When the shots misses, an 'm' is displayed on the field. There are 20 hits left. When the counter reaches 0, you have won.\r\n\r\n###Options\r\nIn the main menu there's an option to play versus the computer (AI). The AI finds locations where ships are at and searches around them. It even checks smart if there are already 2 locations aligned and acts accordingly. When the game is won and the program quits, the results are written to a file named 'statsFile.txt' in the same directory as the game is run.\r\n\r\n###Ending notes\r\nHave fun playing the game! I would like to hear from you if you compiled and played the game and what you think of it. Also I would like to improve my programming skills, so feel free to comment about that too!\r\n\r\n-- Jonathan\r\n\r\n###Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Battleship?
